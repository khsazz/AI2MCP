This thesis addresses the ($N \times M$) integration crisis in robotics by proposing a standardized middleware architecture based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We implement a novel MCP-to-ROS~2 bridge that decouples high-level intelligence from hardware-specific middleware. Our core reasoning engine, the Kinematic-GNN, achieves a validation accuracy of \textbf{97.03\%} on the 55,000-frame ALOHA dataset. Crucially, a fair comparison demonstrates that kinematic-only reasoning (Kinematic-GNN) outperforms multimodal fusion (Multimodal-GNN) in structured domains, being \textbf{16$\times$ faster} (1.5ms latency) and \textbf{7$\times$ more memory-efficient}. We validate "swappable intelligence" by hot-swapping Llama 3.2 and Qwen 2.5 agents, both achieving 100\% success on a 10-goal benchmark. Despite these successes, we identify a critical "Interaction Predicate Gap" for contact-based predicates (F1: 0.000) on real data, highlighting future requirements for haptic sensing.
