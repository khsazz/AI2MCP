    abstract = {In vitro biological neural networks (BNNs) interconnected with robots, so-called BNN-based neurorobotic systems, can interact with the external world, so that they can present some preliminary intelligent behaviors, including learning, memory, robot control, etc. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the intelligent behaviors presented by the BNN-based neurorobotic systems, with a particular focus on those related to robot intelligence. In this work, we first introduce the necessary biological background to understand the 2 characteristics of the BNNs: nonlinear computing capacity and network plasticity. Then, we describe the typical architecture of the BNN-based neurorobotic systems and outline the mainstream techniques to realize such an architecture from 2 aspects: from robots to BNNs and from BNNs to robots. Next, we separate the intelligent behaviors into 2 parts according to whether they rely solely on the computing capacity (computing capacity-dependent) or depend also on the network plasticity (network plasticity-dependent), which are then expounded respectively, with a focus on those related to the realization of robot intelligence. Finally, the development trends and challenges of the BNN-based neurorobotic systems are discussed.},

    abstract = {Data processing in robotics is currently challenged by the effective building of multimodal and common representations. Tremendous volumes of raw data are available and their smart management is the core concept of multimodal learning in a new paradigm for data fusion. Although several techniques for building multimodal representations have been proven successful, they have not yet been analyzed and compared in a given production setting. This paper explored three of the most common techniques, (1) the late fusion, (2) the early fusion, and (3) the sketch, and compared them in classification tasks. Our paper explored different types of data (modalities) that could be gathered by sensors serving a wide range of sensor applications. Our experiments were conducted on Amazon Reviews, MovieLens25M, and Movie-Lens1M datasets. Their outcomes allowed us to confirm that the choice of fusion technique for building multimodal representation is crucial to obtain the highest possible model performance resulting from the proper modality combination. Consequently, we designed criteria for choosing this optimal data fusion technique.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a low-latency and scalable architecture for Edge-Enabled Digital Twin networked control systems (E-DTNCS) aimed at multi-robot collision avoidance and remote control in dynamic and latency-sensitive environments. Traditional approaches, which rely on centralized cloud processing or direct sensor-to-controller communication, are inherently limited by excessive network latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, and a lack of predictive decision-making, thus constraining their effectiveness in real-time multi-agent systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that seamlessly integrates edge computing with digital twin (DT) technology. By performing localized preprocessing at the edge, the system extracts semantically rich features from raw sensor data streams, reducing the transmission overhead of the original data. This shift from raw data to feature-based communication significantly alleviates network congestion and enhances system responsiveness. The DT layer leverages these extracted features to maintain high-fidelity synchronization with physical robots and to execute predictive models for proactive collision avoidance. To empirically validate the framework, a real-world testbed was developed, and extensive experiments were conducted with multiple mobile robots. The results revealed a substantial reduction in collision rates when DT was deployed, and further improvements were observed with E-DTNCS integration due to significantly reduced latency. These findings confirm the system’s enhanced responsiveness and its effectiveness in handling real-time control tasks. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of combining edge intelligence with DT-driven control in advancing the reliability, scalability, and real-time performance of multi-robot systems for industrial automation and mission-critical cyber-physical applications.},
